# Universal Video Downloader & Converter

A powerful and user-friendly desktop application built using Python and Tkinter. It allows you to download videos from a variety of online sources and convert local media files to MP4 or MP3 formats. It uses [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) for content downloading and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) for media conversion tasks.
